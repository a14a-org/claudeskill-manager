# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the repository, issue tracker, discussions, and any other community spaces. It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the project maintainers directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0.
